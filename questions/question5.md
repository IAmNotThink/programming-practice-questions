### Part 1

Generate a random four digit number. The player has to keep inputting four digit numbers until they guess the randomly generated number. After each unsuccessful try it should say how many numbers they got correct, but not which position they got right. At the end of the game, it should congratulate the user and say how many tries it took.

### Part 2 

1. Let the user pick an easy mode which shows the user which position that they guessed correctly
2. Let the user pick a hard mode that gives five digits instead of four
